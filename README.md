# Retail-Sales-dataset-using-excel

This project demonstrates how to **analyze a retail sales dataset** using **Excel**. The goal is to perform various data operations, including summing values, conditional summing, looking up data, calculating averages, and visualizing data using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers.

The project includes **Excel files** with applied functions, charts, and analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on the following **Excel functions and tools** to analyze the dataset:

- **SUM**: To calculate the total sales and other numeric data.
- **SUMIF**: To sum values based on specific conditions.
- **UNIQUE**: To extract unique values from the dataset.
- **VLOOKUP**: To search for data within a table and return corresponding values.
- **AVERAGE**: To calculate average values in the dataset.
- **Cell Referencing**: To create dynamic formulas and reference cells across worksheets.
- **Pivot Table**: To summarize data, categorize, and group it for better insights.
- **Pivot Chart**: To visually represent the summarized data.
- **Slicers**: To filter data in PivotTables and PivotCharts dynamically.

## Steps Covered

### 1. **Summing Values**
- Used the `SUM` function to calculate the total sales and other relevant metrics.

### 2. **Conditional Summing**
- Applied the `SUMIF` function to sum values based on specific conditions (e.g., total sales for a particular region or product).

### 3. **Extracting Unique Values**
- Used the `UNIQUE` function to identify distinct values from a column, such as unique product names or regions.

### 4. **VLOOKUP for Data Search**
- Used `VLOOKUP` to search for specific values in the dataset and retrieve related information, such as looking up product prices or categories.

### 5. **Calculating Averages**
- Applied the `AVERAGE` function to find the average sales, average discount, and other key metrics in the dataset.

### 6. **Cell Referencing**
- Utilized absolute and relative cell references to build dynamic formulas that update when data changes.

### 7. **Pivot Table Creation**
- Created PivotTables to summarize data by various categories (e.g., sales by region, sales by product, etc.).

### 8. **Pivot Chart Creation**
- Generated PivotCharts from the PivotTables to visually represent trends and insights.

### 9. **Using Slicers**
- Added slicers to PivotTables and PivotCharts to dynamically filter and analyze data by different categories, such as product or region.
